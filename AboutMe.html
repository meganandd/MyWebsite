  <p>Hello! I'm Megan. I am 16 years old and currently attend Skyline High School in Sammamish, Washington. I am a swimmer for Klahanie and Skyline's Varsity team. I am also a member of Key Club, NHS, SNHS, and Model UN. I am the webmaster for SNHS and the director of conventions for Model UN. In school, science (especially biology) is my favorite subject!
